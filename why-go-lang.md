* **Easy for developers to master**

C/C++ did not evolve with the computing landscape, no major systems language has emerged

in over a decade: so there is a definite need for a new systems language, appropriate for needs

of our computing era.

- In contrast to computing power, software development is not considerably faster or more

successful \(considering the number of failed projects\) and applications still grow in size, so a

new low-level language, but equipped with higher concepts, is needed.

- Before Go a developer had to choose between fast execution but slow and not efficient building

\(like C++\), efficient compilation \(but not so fast execution, like .NET or Java\), or ease of

programming \(but slower execution, like the dynamic languages\): Go is an attempt to combine

all three wishes: efficient and thus fast compilation, fast execution, ease of programming.
